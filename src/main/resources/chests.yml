# How to use this chest system?
# You have a normal-chest and middle-chest section. The middle-chest section is for the chest settings in the middle of the map.
# The normal-chest section for the ones that are on the player's island or between the island and the middle.
#

# Item list ---> https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
#
# You can put items in the selection of random items for the box by
# writing "-ITEM_NAME". After that you write "#" for the
# number of the maximum stack size.
#
# So "-TEST_ITEM#2" would be in the selection and can be
# maximum 2 items per slot. You can set the item probability
# with the frequency of entries in the section. If there is often the
# same item it will be in the chest with higher probability than all others.
#
# **PLEASE NOTE**
# You can use this plugin in higher or lover version than 1.8, but note
# that you can only use items that are in every version.
# Example: If you add "DIAMOND_SWORD#1" you can use this in every version from 1.7 - Newest. But you cannot
# use items like "- CROSSBOW#1" in 1.8.
